## Project Title - Web-based Retail Store Management System (Clothing Store used for domain example)

## Problem Statement
Small businesses across the country face numerous difficulties and challenges such as managing inventory, online services (i.e. online orders) and customer data efficiently and cost effectively. Many of these current businesses rely on traditional manual processes or outdated systems, leading to inconsistencies on both the customers and admins end of the system. There is a need for an integrated application that sufficiently meets the needs of all its users through the use of a simple, intuitive design. The development of a centralized system will enhance operational efficiency, data accuracy and create a more customer and admin satisfactory experience. 

## Goals and Motivations
The main goal of this project is to design and implement a full stack web application for a clothing store that integrates customer and administrative functionalities. The system will enable users to browse products, manage shopping carts, and place orders while allowing administrators to manage inventory, track sales, and update product information in real time. The application will ensure efficient data management, user authentication and smooth interaction between the frontend and backend components. Our main goals include:
- Full-stack Integration
- Secure User Authentication
- Inventory and Order Tracking
- User Experience Optimization.

Our motivation for this project stems from the desire to apply data management principles and software engineering concepts to a realistic, industry-relevant application. By building a clothing store web platform, the team aims to gain hands-on experience with:

- Designing and normalizing relational databases to handle real-world datasets.
- Implementing CRUD operations within a structured web architecture.
- Integrating API endpoints and front-end frameworks to achieve a dynamic and responsive design.
- Exploring modern web development technologies to simulate real-world e-commerce functionality.

Ultimately, this project provides an opportunity to bridge theoretical concepts from the course with practical implementation skills, resulting in a robust and interactive system that showcases data-driven decision-making and user-centered design 

## Related Works
E-commerce and retail management platforms such as Shopify, and Magento provide small and medium-sized businesses with the tools for online product display, customer orders, and payment processing. Similarly, inventory management and point-of-sale systems(POS) offer features for tracking stock levels and managing sales transactions. These systems are widely used and have many features, but they often come with cons like high subscription fees, complex setup processes, and very limited customization options, thereby making them less suitable for smaller, independent retailers who are seeking affordable and flexible solutions. Our Web-based Retail Store Management System aims to provide a centralized, cost-effective, and user-friendly platform that integrates inventory management, customer orders, and administrative tasks in a single system. We are focusing on data consistency, usability, and our project differentiates itself from existing solutions by emphasizing efficiency and accessibility for small clothing businesses with limited resources.

## Methodology & Project Plan 
For this project, we will be following an Agile development approach. Agile allows us to work in short development cycles, where we can design, test, and improve features as needed. This gives us the time we need to adjust the database design and relationships whenever it is needed.
Firstly, we will need to identify the requirements for both customers and admins, then move into designing the system structure and database. Each stage of development, like user authentication, product management, and order tracking, will be done in small iterations in order to reduce risk and increase flexibility. After each stage, we will test the system to make sure everything works smoothly and correctly before adding new features.
The frontend and backend will be built with software tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and Express. The database management system (MySQL database) will handle product, order, and user information. Once everything is connected, we will test for bugs, host the site online (using software platforms), and prepare our final documentation and demo.
Our project plan runs over about 10 to 11 weeks, where we will start with planning and design in the first few weeks, development in the middle, and testing, deployment, and documentation at the end.
By the end of this project, we will have a functional web-based retail store management system that demonstrates proper data handling, usability, and efficient system design. Our web-based retail store management system, will also be able to connect customers and admins through one simple, reliable, and easy-to-use platform.
